"""
.claude/hooks/hook_utils.py

Helpers shared by the hook scripts in this directory, so each rule has one
definition:

  - project_dir(): the project root every hook anchors on.
  - absolute_path(): one resolution of a path string an agent wrote in a
    tool call (Git Bash, WSL, device-prefix and drive-relative forms).
  - project_path(): how every hook resolves a configured value
    (PRIVATE_VAULT_PATH, VAULT_PATH_TEST). It delegates to
    src/core/vault_path.py, the rule the app's get_private_vault_path()
    uses, so vault_guard.py, secret_dump_guard.py, post_commit_eval.py and
    the app agree on which directory is the live vault.
  - command_name(): one "bare command name" rule (env_guard.py,
    secret_dump_guard.py).
  - read_env_value() / env_file_value(): one .env value reader
    (post_commit_eval.py, vault_guard.py). It never prints a value.
  - deny(): the PreToolUse deny decision the harness reads from stdout
    (env_guard.py, vault_guard.py, secret_dump_guard.py).

Deliberately pathlib- and typing-free: PreToolUse guards start a fresh
Python process on every tool call, and those imports cost ~11 ms each time.
