# CLAUDE.md — Ember-2

Canonical design: `docs/Ember2_TDD.md`
Business requirements: `docs/Ember2_BRequirements.md`
ADRs: `docs/adr/`

---

## What This Project Is

Ember-2 is a **local, private personal intelligence system** — not a chatbot. It supports reasoning grounded in real memory, pattern recognition over time, daily/weekly reflection, and long-term life and work continuity. The goal is a durable personal intelligence layer that improves with use.

The LLM is a reasoning engine. It is not the system of record. All canonical knowledge lives in the filesystem vault.

---

## Core Architectural Rules (Non-Negotiable)

These decisions are locked. Do not undermine them:

1. **Local-first.** No cloud storage of private data. External tools are opt-in.
2. **LLM is not the system of record.** The model generates, summarizes, and reflects. It does not store canonical truth.
3. **Append-only memory.** Records are never overwritten in place. Every change writes a new artifact.
4. **Rebuildable derived artifacts.** Indexes, reflections, and embeddings can all be deleted and rebuilt from canonical vault records. Never treat them as irreplaceable.
5. **Typed memory beats one big pile.** Source, derived, reference, state, archive, and operational artifacts must remain separated. Cross-contamination degrades retrieval.
6. **Source quality before retrieval cleverness.** Clean ingestion and typed metadata come before ranking sophistication.
7. **Constitutional review is orchestration, not training.** The review layer is triggered post-draft, lives in the Cognitive layer, and is governed by `config/constitution.yaml`. It must not contaminate retrieval logic.
8. **Explicit policy over prompt folklore.** Safety, refusal, and review behavior must be visible in code and config — not buried in prompt text or model behavior assumptions.

---

## System Layers

```
Interface Layer      — FastAPI (src/api/), Ember UI (ui/), CLI scripts
Reasoning Layer      — Ollama + local LLM or Anthropic Claude, prompt templates (src/llm/)
Cognitive Layer      — ContextService, ContextRetriever, ContextRanker,
                       ReflectionEngine, SafetyPolicyService, ResponseReviewService
                       (src/context/, src/reflection/, src/safety/)
Memory Layer         — Append-only JSON vault, vector indexes (src/memory/, src/retrieval/)
State Layer          — StateService, StateResolver, StateExtractor, auto-extraction
                       from conversation turns, manual write via POST /write-state (src/state/)
Tool Layer           — PLANNED (src/tasks/ stub exists)
```

The cognitive layer is the brain. It orchestrates retrieval, context assembly, LLM calls, and review routing. The LLM only sees what the cognitive layer gives it.

## Private Vault Layout

```
private_vault/
  memory/
    conversation/   Raw conversation turns
    journal/        Journal entries
    reflection/     Derived daily/weekly reflections
    state/          Active state artifacts (current focus, open loops)
    ingested/       Chunked content from imports
    archive/        Lower-priority preserved material
  embeddings/
    conversation_index.json
    ingested_index.json
    reflection_index.json
    (etc.)
  imports/          Raw source files (ChatGPT exports, docs)
```

The vault path is set via `PRIVATE_VAULT_PATH` in `.env`. See [src/core/config.py](src/core/config.py).

---

## Memory Record Schema

Every canonical record is a JSON file with these required fields:

```json
{
  "id": "2026-03-17T20-15-00",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-17T20-15-00",
  "type": "reflection",
  "text": "...",
  "source": "reflection_engine",
  "tags": ["weekly", "reflection"],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

Valid types (taxonomy may evolve, separation principle must not):
`profile`, `journal`, `conversation`, `reflection`, `summary`, `state`, `task`, `project`, `reference`, `ingested`, `archive`, `system_event`, `decision`, `review_log`, `evaluation`, `session`
Planned (v0.15.0): `deviation` -- chosen behavioral deviations from trained patterns (ADR-013)

Canonical code reference: `VALID_MEMORY_TYPES` in `src/memory/storage.py`. All writes are validated against this set.

---

## Retrieval Architecture

Retrieval is **not** just cosine similarity. The pipeline is:

1. **Intent classification** — `src/context/policies.py` → classify_query() → policy object
2. **Candidate gathering** — semantic + (future: lexical + chronological)
3. **Policy weighting** — type weighting, source quality adjustments
4. **Dedup + diversity selection** — Jaccard-based, cross-type diversity
5. **Context packet** — `ContextPacket` with state_items, reflection_items, memory_items

Boost: user-authored content, concrete experiences, recent state, meaningful reflections
Penalize: assistant filler, tool traces, JSON payloads, short trivial content

Context packet order to model: system prompt → state → reflections → source memories → reference → user query

---

## Constitutional Review Flow

```
User query → Context build → LLM draft → Trigger check
  → not triggered: pass through
  → triggered: constitutional review (allow / revise / refuse+redirect) → log
```

The trigger layer (`SafetyPolicyService`) is fast and heuristic. Review (`ResponseReviewService`) is LLM-assisted. Both are governed by `config/constitution.yaml`. Review outcomes are logged to `logs/safety_reviews/`.

---

## Running the System

```bash
# Start API
./start_api.bat
# or: uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload

# Run retrieval evaluation
python tools/eval_retrieval.py

# Ingest ChatGPT export
python scripts/import_chatgpt.py

# Run daily reflection
python -m src.reflection.run_daily_reflection

# Run weekly reflection
python -m src.reflection.run_weekly_reflection
```

Docker Compose runs SearXNG only (private web search engine). The `ui/` folder contains the built Ember UI frontend, served by FastAPI at the same port.

Key API endpoints:
- `GET /` — serves the Ember UI when ui/ folder exists, otherwise health check JSON
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` — OpenAI-compatible chat
- `GET /debug-context?message=...` — inspect context packet for a query
- `GET /semantic-search?query=...` — direct vector search
- `POST /reflect` — trigger reflection
- `GET /search-memories` — keyword memory search

---

## Current State (v0.11.0-wip)

All items from the original TDD §25 build order are complete through step 6. The system is feature-complete for single-user local deployment on Windows. Cloud reasoning is available via Anthropic Claude with full UI support.

**Core Systems:**
- Append-only JSON vault with typed memory enforcement (`VALID_MEMORY_TYPES`, 17 types)
- Ingestion pipeline (ChatGPT, PDF, DOCX, CSV, TXT, GDrive, POST /ingest/upload multipart)
- Semantic retrieval via vector indexes (cached in memory, no disk load per query)
- Context assembly with policy-weighted ranking, diversity selection, project-scoped boost (ADR-007)
- SSE streaming responses from Ollama or Anthropic through FastAPI
- Cloud model provider support — Anthropic Claude (Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.6) and OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, gpt-3.5-turbo) via LLMAdapter
- Provider API key storage via keyring with env var fallback (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Provider dispatch by model name prefix (`claude-` → Anthropic, `gpt-` → OpenAI, else → Ollama)
- Social engineering safety triggers — 5 attack families, 39 patterns (ADR-010)
- DELETE /provider-key/{provider} endpoint for key removal
- Model selection persists via vault/model_override.json (survives API restarts)
- Auto state extraction from conversation turns (StateExtractor, background thread, threshold: 10 words)
- State layer (StateService, StateResolver, 8 categories, context packet integration)
- Daily and weekly reflection generation (multi-source, junk-filtered, suppression tools)
- Constitutional review (8 principles including authentic_expression, streaming-compatible)
- Conversation sessions (session_id, project_id, rename, soft-delete, auto-title)
- Projects backend (CRUD, conversation assignment, project-scoped retrieval)
- Self-echo prevention (role-labeled context, metadata-aware scoring, -0.25 assistant penalty)
- Temporal grounding (current date injected, timestamps on context items)
- Profile retrieval via semantic search (identity queries for both user and Ember-directed)
- Prompt label: "person Ember is talking to" (prevents identity confusion)
- Buffer compression backgrounded (no longer blocks response)
- Conversation turns never filtered by length (short messages like "Yes" are saved)
- Test session flag (X-Test-Session header, filtered from listings, cleanup script)
- Default model: qwen3:8b (4.9-6.7/10 eval range, best local model tested)
- Ember uses she/her pronouns (system prompt)
- Version field in /api/health endpoint (reads from version.json)

**Evaluation & Tooling:**
- Retrieval evaluation (15 benchmark cases, pass/warn/fail scoring, latency tracking)
- Conversation quality eval with Claude as external evaluator (18 test cases, 6 categories)
- Local model comparison eval (automated, all installed models, comparison table) — `tools/eval_local_models.py`
- Cloud model eval: Claude Haiku 4.5 scored 8.7/10, Claude Sonnet 4.6 scored 8.5/10
- Eval history: `docs/eval_history.md` (all models, full category breakdowns, variance documentation)
- Model selection guide: `docs/model_guide.md` (linked from installer model selection screen)
- Vault health audit (7 checks, GREEN/YELLOW/RED health score, --fix flag)
- Reflection quality audit and suppression tools
- `scripts/set_provider_key.py` CLI (--provider, --check, --remove)
- `scripts/cleanup_test_sessions.py` for soft-deleting eval conversations

**Security:**
- API key auth via Windows Credential Manager
- Auth only on API routes — UI static files are public
- Rate limiting, path traversal protection, JSON audit logging
- SearXNG bound to localhost only
- Tailscale serve uses localhost binding
- Vault path masked in UI with timed reveal (ADR-012 Phase 1)
- Cloud API keys stored in OS credential store, never displayed in UI

**UI (ember-2-ui, served from ui/):**
- Streaming chat with markdown, copy, edit/resend, regenerate, scroll-to-bottom, export
- Collapsible sidebar with icon row (new conversation, search, collapse) and localStorage persistence
- Model indicator in top bar (muted dot local, pulsing accent dot cloud, click opens settings)
- Local/Cloud model selector tabs in Settings with underline-style active indicator
- Secure API key entry in Cloud tab (masked password input, credential store disclosure, never displayed)
- Remove key with inline confirmation dialog
- Vault path masked by default, eye icon reveals for 10 seconds, copy without displaying
- Vision toggle defaults to on when vision model configured, persisted in localStorage
- Version reads from /api/health not hardcoded
- Sidebar with projects, conversations, search, right-click context menu, New Project button
- Settings: 5 themes, web search toggle, conversation memory toggle
- About panel with Ember's story, beliefs, ethos
- Bug reports to GitHub Issues, update checker
- PWA manifest for Android/iOS home screen installation
- Consistent Ember-2 branding, WCAG 2.1 AA accessible
- .txt file upload support with document context injection into chat message

**Installer (ember-2-installer):**
- Auto-install prerequisites via winget (Git, Python, Node, Ollama, Docker)
- Curated model cards with eval-based descriptions, disk sizes, RAM requirements
- Default model: qwen3:8b (was qwen2.5:14b)
- Model selection guide linked from model selection screen and Done screen
- Venv/API lock detection, auto-start API with health check polling
- Retry button on Done screen with warm troubleshooting hints
- Tailscale walkthrough, progress bar + fun facts, pip time warning
- Clones ember-2 repo, builds UI from ember-2-ui
- git pull uses origin main explicitly (no tracking info errors)

**Tests:**
- ember-2 backend: 300 pytest tests passing
- ember-2-ui: 37 Playwright e2e tests passing, 2 skipped (cloud model, remove key)

## Immediate Next Priorities

**v0.11.0 remaining work (bugs first):**
- Fix: search bar loses focus after each character — must fix before release
- Fix: installer missing Node.js prerequisite check
- Fix: installer not running npm install and npm run build after clone
- Fix: installer Done screen not verifying UI is built before enabling Open Ember
- Multi-record state categories for open_loop and next_action (ADR-011)
- Mobile testing via Tailscale
- Web search transparency indicator — show what phrase triggered search and what was sent to SearXNG
- Conversational style definitions — add plain-language descriptions to Casual/Balanced/Thoughtful in Settings
- Tray icon / OS notifications research

**v0.12.0 — Task Layer + Session Reflection + Mac/Linux:**
- Task objects with ISC verifiable completion criteria
- Task CRUD API and state lifecycle
- Task layer ADR
- Session reflection mode (end-of-session capture, ADR-009)
- Mac and Linux installer support
- Reflection corpus guidance in onboarding (set expectations on timeline)
- Local PIN/passphrase lock for UI (ADR-012 Phase 2)
- Guided first-run UI tour with acknowledgment — walks new users through key features with chat examples
- Electron upgrade 28 → 29+ (unblocks Playwright e2e tests for installer, requires electron-builder compatibility testing first)

**v0.13.0 — Memory Tiering + Embedding Upgrade + Encryption:**
- Hot/warm/cold memory tiering by recency and relevance
- nomic-embed-text embedding upgrade via Ollama
- Index migration for remaining JSON indexes to SQLite
- Monthly/thematic reflection
- Vault encryption at rest (Ember-managed, with key recovery story)
- Custom theme with color picker — user-defined accent and background colors

**v0.14.0 — Offline Knowledge:**
- Kiwix ZIM ingestion adapter (curated packs only)
- Project Gutenberg adapter (epub/txt/html as Reference Memory)
- Curated pack recommendations in docs
- NOMAD-compatible path supported

**v0.15.0 — Agent Orchestration:**
- Self-evaluation and decision-memory loops
- OpenJarvis Learning primitive as reference implementation
- Controlled tool writes with stricter policy gates

**Post-v0.15.0:**
- Multi-user vault isolation
- Windows/Mac/Linux full parity across all features

## Watch Items
- OpenJarvis Learning primitive — reference for self-evaluation loops (active at v0.15.0)
- PAI TELOS pattern — evaluate against constitution + profile memory during v0.11.0 onboarding work
- Multi-user vault isolation — post-v0.15.0 milestone
- Eval harness uses user's own vault — results are personal, not generic benchmarks

## Known Gaps (tracked)
- Vault encryption at rest — v0.13.0
- ~~Social engineering trigger upgrade~~ — complete (v0.11.0, ADR-010)
- Mac/Linux installer — v0.12.0
- ~~Backup/export story~~ — complete (v0.11.0, docs/BACKUP_AND_EXPORT.md)
- ~~Recovery playbook~~ — complete (v0.11.0, docs/RECOVERY_PLAYBOOK.md)

## Known Issues
- Search bar loses focus after each character — must click to type each letter. Blocks usability.
- Installer missing Node.js prerequisite check — partner install failed because Node wasn't installed and the installer didn't catch it
- Installer not running npm install and npm run build after clone — UI folder empty on fresh install, user gets 404
- Installer Done screen not verifying UI is built before enabling Open Ember
- qwen3:8b hallucination pattern: generates news-sounding content without web search when context is poor. Model limitation, not a code bug. classify_query() web search triggers investigated and confirmed clean. Cloud models do not exhibit this. Documented in eval_history.md.
- Old soft-deleted conversations may still show in UI sidebar. Soft-delete filter investigation pending.
- Installer Playwright e2e tests: blocked on Electron 28.3.3 incompatibility with Playwright 1.58+ (requires `--remote-debugging-pipe`, not supported until Electron 29). Tests written and correct. Fix: upgrade Electron to 29+ in v0.12.0 after electron-builder compatibility testing.

---

## What Not to Touch

- `private_vault/` — never commit, never rewrite in place, never treat index files as source of truth
- The core architectural bets (local-first, append-only, LLM not system of record, triggered post-draft review) — these are the right bones
- `config/constitution.yaml` — external config by design; do not move governance into code or prompts
- The separation between retrieval logic and review logic — these must remain in separate services with no cross-dependency

---

## Testing

```bash
pytest tests/
```

244 tests covering: constitution loader, policy service, review service, vault read/write, state layer, state extractor, project boost, index caching, memory type enforcement, health check, ingest upload, cloud provider dispatch, provider API key management.
Tests do not mock the filesystem vault (real path via `PRIVATE_VAULT_PATH`). Integration tests hit real storage.

When adding features: unit test normalizers, filters, ranking functions, and state resolution. Integration test full pipeline paths.

---

## Working With This Codebase

- Code is written by AI, reviewed and approved by the human
- Always replace full files — never partial find-and-replace edits
- Work on one file at a time
- Small, frequent commits with clear descriptive messages
- Tag commits at major milestones
- After milestones: update TDD first, then README
- Code must be clean, well-commented, forward-thinking, and scalable
- If the human says **PAUSE** — stop and reorient
- If the human says **STOP** — drop the topic entirely
- The human has ADHD and Autism — minimize cognitive overhead, be explicit about what is changing and why before touching anything
- Before editing any file, state: what file, what change, and what the commit message will be

## Release Checklist

When cutting a release (tagging a new version), always update these files:

1. `version.json` — bump the version string (installer reads this to display Ember version)
2. `CHANGELOG.md` — add a new section for the version with changes, bug fixes, test count
3. `docs/Ember2_TDD.md` — mark completed items in §25, update roadmap
4. `CLAUDE.md` — update Current State version, test count, any new capabilities
5. `README.md` — update Current State version, test count, roadmap if changed
6. Git tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z — summary"`
7. Push: `git push origin main` then `git push origin vX.Y.Z`
8. **Create GitHub release:** `gh release create vX.Y.Z --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "summary"` — the installer update checker compares against GitHub releases, not git tags. If you skip this step, the installer will show a stale "Latest" version.

If the installer repo (ember-2-installer) has changes, also bump `package.json` version and tag.

## Key Design Risks to Watch

| Risk | Watch for |
|---|---|
| Contaminated corpus | Low-quality ingestion slipping through filters |
| Index corruption | Oversized or malformed JSON index files |
| Mixed memory types | Ingested content written to wrong type folder |
| Assistant self-echo | Prior assistant responses polluting retrieved context |
| Prompt folklore creep | Policy decisions migrating into prompt text instead of code |
| Over-triggering review | Safety triggers firing on benign queries — check logs |
| State layer absent | System can remember but not manage current operational context |
